## Zero-Knowledge Proof Implementation

### Circuit Design

The system uses a custom circom circuit (`income_range.circom`) to prove that a taxpayer's income falls within a specific range without revealing the exact amount:

```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

include "node_modules/circomlib/circuits/comparators.circom";
include "node_modules/circomlib/circuits/poseidon.circom";

template IncomeRange() {
    signal input income;
    signal input randomSecret;
    signal input lowerBound;
    signal input upperBound;
    
    signal output commitment;
    signal output inRange;
    
    // Generate commitment
    component hasher = Poseidon(2);
    hasher.inputs[0] <== income;
    hasher.inputs[1] <== randomSecret;
    commitment <== hasher.out;
    
    // Check if income is in range
    component greaterThanLower = GreaterEqThan(64);
    greaterThanLower.in[0] <== income;
    greaterThanLower.in[1] <== lowerBound;
    
    component lessThanUpper = LessEqThan(64);
    lessThanUpper.in[0] <== income;
    lessThanUpper.in[1] <== upperBound;
    
    inRange <== greaterThanLower.out * lessThanUpper.out;
}

component main = IncomeRange();
```

### ZKP Workflow

1. **Circuit Compilation**:
   - The circom circuit is compiled to generate R1CS constraints
   - WebAssembly code is generated for witness calculation
   - A symbolic setup is performed to generate proving and verification keys

2. **Commitment Generation**:
   - User inputs income and a random secret
   - System generates a cryptographic commitment using Poseidon hash
   - Commitment is stored in the database

3. **Proof Generation**:
   - User selects an income range
   - System generates a ZKP that proves the income is within the range
   - Proof and public signals are stored in the database

4. **Proof Verification**:
   - Backend verifies the proof using snarkjs
   - Optionally, the proof can be verified on-chain
   - Verification result determines tax bracket

## Blockchain Integration

### Contract Deployment

Smart contracts are deployed using Hardhat with the following process:

1. Compile contracts: `npx hardhat compile`
2. Generate verification contract from ZKP verification key
3. Deploy contracts: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia`
4. Store contract addresses and ABIs for frontend and backend use

### Transaction Flow

1. **Tax Payment**:
   - Backend prepares transaction data
   - Transaction is signed using the server's private key
   - Transaction is submitted to the Ethereum network
   - System monitors transaction status
   - Receipt is generated once transaction is confirmed

2. **On-Chain Verification**:
   - ZKP is submitted to the ZKPVerifier contract
   - Contract verifies the proof using the groth16 algorithm
   - Verification result is emitted as an event
   - Backend listens for verification events

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Role-based access control for API endpoints
- Password hashing using bcrypt with salt
- HTTPS for all API communications

### Blockchain Security

- Private keys stored securely using environment variables

- Reentrancy protection in smart contracts
- Access control for contract functions

### ZKP Security

- Trusted setup for ZKP parameters
- Secure storage of proving and verification keys
- Validation of all inputs before proof generation
- Protection against malleability attacks
